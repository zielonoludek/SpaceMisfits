  crewmateDescription: Once an assembly-line worker in a shipyard, Sally was discarded
    and fired after an accident. Refusing to be useless, she built her own special
    goggles and found new ways to see; she can detect heat and energy signatures
    from miles away. With her new abilities, she became an independent contractor,
    working on ships or lookout points.
