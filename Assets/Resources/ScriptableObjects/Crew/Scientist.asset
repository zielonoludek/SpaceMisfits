  crewmateDescription: "\nOnce, he was a rising star in corporate funded research.
    One of his greatest achievements was crafting a piece of ground-breaking technology
    able to localize rare resources and minerals. He thought that he was paving the
    way for the betterment of the future and further exploration of the galaxy. But
    soon, he realized that his corporate overlords thought only about one thing,
    profit. They wanted to strip the whole stars bare, and he wouldn\u2019t allow
    it."
