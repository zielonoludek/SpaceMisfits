  crewmateDescription: "Clawspoon is a name known by some. People tell mysterious
    stories relating to his time before becoming a seafaring pirate/chef. Some say
    he defrauded a major corporation out of millions of credits. Some say that he
    robbed the biggest bank of silver in these parts, and some\u2026 That he killed
    a man with only one of his claws. There is only one thing for sure about him.
    He can create a feast with two salted crackers and a pile of jerky worthy to
    die for."
