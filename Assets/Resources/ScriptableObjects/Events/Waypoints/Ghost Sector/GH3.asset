  eventDescription: "As you wait and your crew grows weary, strange and unexplained
    phenomena begin to happen. Distant voices and the thundering echoes of a space
    battle ring out in the distance. Colorful sparks and shapes emerge within the
    nebula fog, only to vanish moments later.\n\nAnd then, out of nowhere, a small
    asteroid collides with your ship\u2019s hull. As your crew rushes to check for
    damage, a voice comes through your comm device:\n\n\"Captain, I found something.
    But I need more time to get it into my vessel.\""
