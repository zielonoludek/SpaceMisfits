  eventType: 2
  eventDescription: 'You send one of your crew members out in a small vessel, tethered
    to your ship by a steel-knitted rope. The vessel''s primary purpose is as an
    emergency escape pod, and without the sonar built into your ship, it could easily
    get lost without the rope.


    Now, the only thing you can do is wait. While
    your crew visibly grows anxious and discontent with your decision.'
