  eventDescription: 'Every tavern and spaceport has its own tales and legends, which
    spacefarers and pirates treat as facts. One of these is about Sector 345-B, known
    as the Ghost Sector.


    Many ships have ventured there, and none have returned.
    At least if you believe the tales... Nebula fog obscures most of your path through
    the sector, but your radar pings continuously. There might be some tresure hidden
    here, of course if you''re bold enough to send your crewmates for a closer look.'
