  eventDescription: 'Every spaceport has its own tales and legends, which spacefarers
    and pirates treat as facts. One of these is about Sector 345-B, known as the
    Ghost Sector.


    Many ships have ventured there, and none have returned. At
    least if you believe the tales... Nebula fog obscures most of this sector, but
    your radar pings continuously. There might be tresure hidden here, of course
    if you''re bold enough to look for it'
