  eventDescription: While resting at a space tavern, you encounter a mysterious hooded
    patron sitting in a corner booth, eying you constantly. After a while, you approach
    him and start a conversation. He explains that he heard one or two things about
    you, and he has a favor to ask. A couple of sectors from here, a scientist funded
    by a space corporation has some important research that may lead to strip mining
    entire worlds. He wants you to get to the scientist and destroy the data before
    he can deliver it to the corporation HQ
