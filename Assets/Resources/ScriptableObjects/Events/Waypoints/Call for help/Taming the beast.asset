  eventDescription: 'Noticing that the beast is wounded and probably just protecting
    its eggs, you leave it some food to gain its trust, which the creature slowly
    accepts.


    A while later, you manage to set up a warning beacon in the sector
    and contact a space zoologist, who informs you that the creature is actually
    a herbivore.'
