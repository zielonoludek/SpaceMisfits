  eventDescription: 'A slow, humming melody fills the air, soon followed by a beautiful
    woman''s voice singing, resonating in the ears of your crewmates.


    In the
    small asteroid belt, a stunning woman sits atop a wreck, singing while gazing
    longingly at your ship. You can see its effect on your crew, they begin to shift,
    almost unconsciously, gathering near the port deck, entranced by the song.'
