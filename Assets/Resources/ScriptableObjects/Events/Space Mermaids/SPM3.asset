  eventDescription: "And as you listen, you find yourself unable to resist the urge
    to grab a piece of parchment and start scribbling. Then, just as suddenly as
    it began, the song ends, and the creature vanishes. \n\nLeaving you with what
    appears to be a fragment of a map, drawn by your own hand, overtaken by the melody."
