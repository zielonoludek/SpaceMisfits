  eventTitle: A magical song
  eventType: 0
  eventDescription: "As you listen closely, you begin to understand or rather, feel,
    the meaning behind the song.\n\n\tThe creature, clearly not human, sings with
    deep melancholy of an older time, when the cosmos was a simpler place, untouched
    by relentless expansion. \nBut when her eyes  meets yours, the song shifts becoming
    more hopeful. She sings of a place, forgotten and undiscovered, a world still
    free."
