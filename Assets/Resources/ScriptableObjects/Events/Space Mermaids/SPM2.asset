  eventDescription: "As you listen closely, you begin to understand or rather, feel,
    the meaning behind the song.\n\nThe creature, clearly not human, sings with deep
    melancholy of an older time, when the cosmos was a simpler place, untouched by
    relentless expansion. But when her eyes  meets yours, the song shifts becoming
    more hopeful. She sings of a place, forgotten and undiscovered, a world still
    free.\n\nAnd as you listen, you find yourself unable to resist the urge to grab
    a piece of parchment and start scribbling. Then, just as suddenly as it began,
    the song ends, and the creature vanishes. \n\nLeaving you with what appears to
    be a fragment of a map, drawn by your own hand, overtaken by the melody."
