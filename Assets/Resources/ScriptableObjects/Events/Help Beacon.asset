  eventDescription: "Slow and methodical data streams ping and reflect off your radars.
    Not long after, the green hue of an emergency beacon is picked up by your spyglasser.\n\nSomeone
    had to have left it here, and the transmitted data you decrypted points to the
    location of the ship this emergency beacon was once a part of. It might be worth
    to investigate the location along your travels.  \n\n"
