  eventDescription: 'Waiting in this bone-chilling place is an experience you never
    want to repeat. But finally, your crew spots the flickering lights of the vessel
    you sent to scavenge.


    They return with tales of a corrupted AI matrix and
    a haul of valuable equipment. But most intriguing of all they''ve recovered a
    fragment of a map, one that perfectly fits with the two pieces you''ve already
    found.'
