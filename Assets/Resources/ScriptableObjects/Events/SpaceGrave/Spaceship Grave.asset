  eventDescription: "\tSince entering this sector, strange static has been constantly
    interfering with your comms. As your crew tries to pinpoint the source, towering
    masts begin to rise over the eerie horizon, like a ghostly forest adrift in space.\n\tYou
    have entered a massive spaceship graveyard, a place where AI-powered ships go
    to die. There might be something valuable there... if you're not afraid to look,
    of course."
