  eventDescription: 'As your crew begins to panic, you wearing brown pants and possessing
    nerves of steel immediately get them to work. Thanks to swift action and the
    risk of damaging the ship in the process, you manage to escape just in time.


    While
    your crew is alive and well, the same cannot be said for your ship. The gravitational
    pull of the anomaly has left it badly damaged, tearing your sails and straining
    the hull. '
