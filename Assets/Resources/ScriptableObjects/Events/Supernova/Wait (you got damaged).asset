  eventDescription: "As your crew panics, you wearing brown pants and nerves of steel
    command them to wait. They may think you\u2019re mad, but you have a plan. The
    tension thickens, but as the moment arrives, you yell, \"Full speed ahead!\",
    escaping just in time.\n\nWhile your crew is alive and well, the same cannot
    be said for your ship. The anomaly\u2019s pull has left it badly damaged, tearing
    your sails and straining the hull.\n\n"
