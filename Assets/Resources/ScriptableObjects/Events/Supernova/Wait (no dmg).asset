  eventDescription: "As your crew begins to panic, you wearing brown pants and possessing
    nerves of steel command them to wait. They may think you\u2019re a madman, but
    at least you have a plan. \n\nThe tension thickens, but when the moment comes
    and you\u2019re in the right position within the shrinking gravitational pull,
    you yell, \"Full speed ahead!\" and escape at the last moment. "
