# 🚀 Space Misfits

**Space Misfits** is a single-player adventure strategy game where players take command of a pirate spaceship. Far from being ruthless outlaws, these spacefaring misfits are on a mission to find a safe haven and establish a **Somewhat Socially Responsible Space Colony (SSRSC)**.  

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

Players must:
- ⚙️ Manage their ship and crew
- 📋 Fulfill dynamic crew requests
- 🧠 Use strategic Captain’s Orders (special crew abilities)
- 💬 Balance resources, morale, and ethical choices
- 🌌 Explore deep space, from scavenging old wrecks to encountering Milky Way Whales

Every decision matters and shapes your crew’s path toward building something better out in the stars.
